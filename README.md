# Practicer: a music reading practice app

Concept by [Samuel Araya](https://www.samuelaraya.com), created by Andrew Debevec.

Learn how to read music by identifying pitches based on notation, with audio playback and instant feedback.

## Code details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Audio playback created using [Reactronia](https://github.com/unkleho/reactronica).

SVG graphics created by author manually, except for the clefs, which are from Wikimedia.

## Personal notes

This is my first React project; the project itself is a successor to a Ruby on Rails version of Practicer, and was put together over several Saturday morning coding sessions.
